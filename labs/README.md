# 🔬 Cybersecurity Labs

This directory contains hands-on technical projects that demonstrate practical cybersecurity skills, tools, and analysis. Unlike guided room walkthroughs, these labs are exploratory, research-driven, or created from real-world practice scenarios.

## 🧪 Example Lab Topics
- Wireshark and PCAP analysis
- Log parsing and anomaly detection
- Bash and Python scripting for automation
- Vulnerability scanning and enumeration
- SIEM rule tuning or threat hunting exercises

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each lab folder includes:
- `README.md` with overview, objectives, and key takeaways
- Screenshots or analysis artifacts (e.g., `.pcap`, `.py`, `.sh`)
- Custom scripts or tools used during the lab

## ✅ Why Labs Matter

Labs demonstrate your ability to:
- Think critically and solve problems independently
- Apply concepts from certifications like Security+ and real-world frameworks
- Build a portfolio that sets you apart from other entry-level candidates
