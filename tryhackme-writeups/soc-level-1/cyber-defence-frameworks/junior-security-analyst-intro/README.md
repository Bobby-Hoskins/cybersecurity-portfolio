## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection
This room was a solid entry point into the real-world expectations of junior analysts. I appreciated the structure of escalating threats and simulating responses to suspicious activity, which mirrors the type of work expected in Tier 1 SOC roles. It helped clarify how alert triage fits into the larger incident response process.
