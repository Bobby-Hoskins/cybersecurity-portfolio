# üîó Cyber Kill Chain  
> **TryHackMe: SOC Level 1 ‚Äì Cyber Defence Frameworks**  
> Completed: April 13, 2025

## üîç Overview  
This room explores the **Cyber Kill Chain**, a threat intelligence model developed by Lockheed Martin that breaks down the lifecycle of a cyberattack into seven distinct phases. It helps defenders identify where an attacker is within their operation and guides proactive strategies to detect, respond to, and prevent attacks before objectives are reached.

## üí° Key Takeaways  
- Understanding each phase allows SOC teams to detect and disrupt attacks early.  
- Many real-world attacks follow this structured progression.  
- Real-world techniques like phishing, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration were mapped to each stage.  
- Detection is most effective when defenders can ‚Äúbreak the chain‚Äù before attackers reach their final objective.

## üîß Tools / Models Learned  
- Cyber Kill Chain Framework  
- OSINT Reconnaissance  
- Payload creation and macro delivery  
- Exploitation and backdoor installation  
- C2 channels and beaconing  
- Exfiltration and destruction techniques  
- MITRE ATT&CK tactics applied in practice

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection  
This room clarified how attackers move from information gathering to full system compromise and data theft. It was insightful to walk through each stage of the kill chain using realistic tools and techniques. Mapping them to real-world breaches emphasized the value of layered defense. I now have a stronger understanding of where detection efforts can be prioritized to break the chain early.
