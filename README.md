## 🧪 Featured Projects

- 🔍 [Internal IT Audit – Botium Toys](./botium-toys-audit)  
  A full internal audit simulation based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, including a written report, controls checklist, and compliance evaluation.

- 📡 [DNS & ICMP Incident Report](./incident-reports/network-traffic-analysis)  
  Analyzed captured `tcpdump` logs to identify a DNS resolution failure caused by unreachable port 53. Delivered a professional report based on real-world SOC workflows.

- 🛑 [SYN Flood Attack – DoS Incident Report](./incident-reports/network-attacks/syn-flood-analysis)  
  Investigated a SYN flood denial-of-service attack using Wireshark logs. Wrote a detailed report explaining the attack, TCP handshake disruption, and server impact.

- 🌐 [Web Redirection Analysis – HTTP/DNS Incident Report](./incident-reports/web-redirection-analysis)  
  Explored malicious domain redirection activity through tcpdump logs and identified how redirection patterns can reveal phishing or spoofing attempts.
