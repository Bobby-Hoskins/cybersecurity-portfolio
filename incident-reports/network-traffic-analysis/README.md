## 📘 Overview

This report analyzes network traffic captured using `tcpdump` during a simulated cybersecurity incident. The traffic log reveals repeated failed DNS queries and corresponding ICMP error messages. The activity demonstrates how to identify communication issues at the network layer, isolate root causes, and document findings in a professional incident report format.

## 🔧 Skills Demonstrated

- Network protocol analysis (DNS, ICMP, UDP)
- Use of `tcpdump` for traffic inspection
- Incident response documentation
- Identifying root cause of communication failure
- Cybersecurity reporting and writing

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- ICMP error responses such as “UDP port unreachable” are critical clues in diagnosing service interruptions.
- DNS failures can stem from service misconfigurations, network firewalls, or potential DoS attacks.
- Structured analysis and reporting are core competencies for entry-level SOC analysts and IT security roles.
