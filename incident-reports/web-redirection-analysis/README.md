## 📘 Overview

This report analyzes suspicious web redirection activity captured in a `tcpdump` log. The analysis identifies an abrupt change in outbound HTTP traffic from one domain to another, raising concerns about potential phishing behavior or malware distribution through spoofed websites.

The report highlights how DNS resolution and TCP handshakes led to the redirection, and it discusses how such patterns can indicate attacker-controlled infrastructure used to deceive users.
