# 🛡️ Internal Security Audit – Botium Toys

This repository showcases a simulated internal IT security audit for Botium Toys, a fictional toy company with global online operations. The project follows best practices based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and evaluates the company’s current security posture across asset management, technical controls, and compliance standards (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 1/SOC 2).


## 🧩 Scenario Summary

Botium Toys is a small U.S.-based toy company with growing international and online operations. As the business expands, concerns have emerged about its ability to protect sensitive data and meet regulatory requirements. The company has never undergone a formal IT audit and lacks several key security controls, including encryption, access management, backups, and disaster recovery planning. This audit simulates the role of an internal IT auditor tasked with evaluating Botium Toys’ current security posture, identifying high-risk vulnerabilities, and recommending improvements using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework as guidance.
